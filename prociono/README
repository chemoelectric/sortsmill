Prociono
--------

This is the source distribution of the Prociono fonts. The fonts and
the FontForge .sfd file from which they are made have been placed in
the public domain. Configuration files and makefiles may be
copyrighted, and licensed as free software.

To install fonts from this distribution, first install the Sorts Mill
Tools package. Then what you do can be as simple as:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

The 'configure' script can take some options:

    --disable-opentype     Don't generate PostScript-flavored
                           OpenType fonts.

    --disable-truetype     Don't generate TrueType fonts.

    --with-fontsdir=DIR    Specify the directory where fonts
                           are to be installed. (By default
                           they are placed in
                           /usr/local/share/fonts/sortsmill)

See also the file called 'INSTALL', where even more options are
discussed.


Appendix
--------

One also can make a zip-package of pre-generated fonts as follows:

    ./configure
    make prociono-X.X.zip

where 'X.X' should be replaced with the current version number.  In
this case the --enable-FEATURE and --with-fontsdir options described
above are ignored.
