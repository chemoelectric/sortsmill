The 'python' subdirectory contains Python scripts for FontForge. The
author uses them by making ~/.FontForge/python be a symbolic link to
the directory (in a local Mercurial repository); scripted menu options
will appear in the 'Tools' menus of the font and glyph dialogs. He
also has ~/.FontForge/python in his PYTHONPATH, so the scripts can be
imported into Python programs.

Other subdirectories contain 'source code' for font families:
typically FontForge .sfd files, Adobe feature files, Python scripts,
and Makefiles.
