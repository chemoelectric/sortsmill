Sorts Mill is developing a packaging system based on GNU Autotools,
and also is reorganizing. A lot of things are changing, therefore.

The 'tools' subdirectory contains Python scripts for FontForge. There
is Python code that adds stuff to the "Tools" menus in an interactive
FontForge session, and there is code that is run from the command line
or a Makefile to generate fonts from "source code". Some code does both.

Other subdirectories contain "source code" for font families.
