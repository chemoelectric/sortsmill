Sortsmill Tools
---------------

This package contains mainly Python scripts for use with
FontForge. These need to be installed before Sorts Mill fonts can be
built from source. To build Sorts Mill fonts, you also will need the
FontForge extension for Python.

The scripts also can add features to the FontForge GUI. Install the
package, and then do something like the following:

    mkdir -p ~/.FontForge/python
    echo 'from sortsmill import *' > ~/.FontForge/python/sortsmill_python.py

See also the file called 'INSTALL'.
