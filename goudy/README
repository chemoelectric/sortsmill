Sorts Mill Goudy
----------------

This is the source distribution of the Sorts Mill Goudy fonts.

To install fonts from this distribution, first install the Sorts Mill
Tools package. Then what you do can be as simple as:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

The 'configure' script can take some options:

    --disable-opentype     Don't generate PostScript-flavored
                           OpenType fonts.

    --disable-truetype     Don't generate TrueType fonts.

    --enable-ofl           Generate the 'OFL Sorts Mill Goudy'
                           fonts, which are covered by the
                           SIL Open Font License.

    --disable-mit          Don't generate the default 'Sorts
                           Mill Goudy' fonts, which are covered
                           by a permissive, 'MIT-style' license.

    --disable-graphite     Don't include Graphite support in
                           TrueType fonts.

    --with-fontsdir=DIR    Specify the directory where fonts
                           are to be installed. (By default
                           they are placed in
                           /usr/local/share/fonts/sortsmill)

See also the file called 'INSTALL', where even more options are
discussed.


Appendix
--------

One also can make zip-packages of pre-generated fonts as follows:

    ./configure
    make goudy-X.X.zip

or

    ./configure
    make ofl-goudy-X.X.zip

where 'X.X' should be replaced with the current version number.
In this case the --enable-FEATURE and --with-fontsdir options
described above are ignored.
